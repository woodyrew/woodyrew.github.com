## The 10 minute exercie routine.
High intensity interval training (HIIT) isn't new, this is a version I worked out for my girlfriend that works pretty well as a ~4 times a week session.  I'm not a sports scientist and following this routine is entirely at your own risk.*

I've applied it to running but you could take the same forumla and apply it to cycling, swimming or rowing etc.  So, the routine goes as follows:

* 2 mins - Slow jog to warm up
* 20 seconds - Sprint
* 2 mins - Jog
* 20 seconds - Sprint
* 2 mins - Jog
* 20 seconds - Sprint
* 3 mins - Slow jog to warm down

= 10 Minutes!  Boom you're done, cool down and have a shower.

More information on HIIT can be found [on Wikipedia (HIIT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) or google [High intensity interval training](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=high+intensity+interval+training).
