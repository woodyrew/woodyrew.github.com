I'm doing a small project which is a Sailing Race Compass using my phone's sensors to provide the data.

Initially I'm just going to use the in built [Device Orientation](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/) but then use [Geolocation](http://html5doctor.com/finding-your-position-with-geolocation/) if I wanted to verify the readings/enchance the functionality.
